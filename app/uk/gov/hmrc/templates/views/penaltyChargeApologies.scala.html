<h2>We have charged you a penalty by mistake</h2>
<p>On 9 December 2020, we charged you a penalty by mistake. We are sorry about this, and for any inconvenience that it may have caused you.</p>
<p>The penalty was for your 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return being 12 months late. We have now cancelled that penalty, and you do not have to pay it, because your return is not 12 months late.</p>
<h2>About other penalties we have charged you</h2>
<p>The other penalties we have charged you for not filing your tax return are correct. This includes the initial penalty for your return being late, as well as the penalty for your return being 6 months late.</p>
<p>We explained more about the penalties that you may be charged, and when we might charge them, in our letter dated 18 November 2020.</p>
<h2>What you need to do next</h2>
If you have:
<ul class="bullets">
    <li>not yet paid the other penalties, please pay them as soon as you can</li>
    <li>not yet filed your 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, please file it now - we may charge you a penalty if your return is 12 months late (it will be 12 months late on 1 February 2021)</li>
    <li>filed your return but not yet paid what you owe for that return, please pay as soon as you can or contact us to agree a payment arrangement</li>
</ul>
<p>The section below tells you about help that’s available if you’re having problems paying.</p>
<h2>Help if you think you’ll have problems paying</h2>
<p>If you think you’ll have problems paying what you owe for your 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, you can ask us for a <a  target="_self" data-sso="false" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-issue-briefing-disguised-remuneration-charge-on-loans/issue-briefing-disguised-remuneration-on-loans#time-pay">‘time to pay’ arrangement</a>. This lets you pay what you owe in instalments. A time to pay arrangement can include everything you owe us, including penalties and interest.</p>
<p>If you want a time to pay arrangement that includes the tax you owe for your 2018 to 2019 return, you’ll need to file your return first. So please do it as soon as you can.</p>
<p>You should then phone our loan charge helpline on 03000 599 110 (Monday to Friday 8.30am to 5pm, excluding bank holidays). We can discuss your options with you and agree an affordable time to pay arrangement.</p>
